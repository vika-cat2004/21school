The bitwise XOR (exclusive or) performs a logical XOR function, which is equivalent to adding two bits and discarding the carry. 
The result is zero only when we have two zeroes or two ones. XOR can be used to toggle the bits between 1 and 0. 
Thus i = i ^ 1 when used in a loop toggles its values between 1 and 0.
