# A makefile consists of targets and commands that need to be executed to reach the target.

# Let's write a simple Makefile for the project, which consists of the following files: main.c, math.c, math.h, console_gui.c, console_gui.h, common_structures.h

# "all" is the default target unless otherwise specified. After ":" we specified dependencies for "all" target. In our case it's target "build"
# It means that make utility will run every targets to achieve the "build" target on which "all" depends
all: build

# "Build" target depends on main.o math.o console_gui.o and build the final executable file of the app
build: main.o math.o console_gui.o
    gcc main.o math.o console_gui.o -o main

# "main.o" target depends on main.c
main.o: main.c
    gcc -c main.c

# "console_gui.o" target depends on console_gui.c
console_gui.o: console_gui.c
    gcc -c console_gui.c

# "math.o" target depends on math.c
math.o: math.c
    gcc -c math.c

# "clean" target tells make utility to clean all of the objects files
clean:
    rm -rf *.o main
